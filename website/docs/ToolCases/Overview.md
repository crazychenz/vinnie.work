## Overview

_Tool Cases_ is simply a mash up of _Use Cases_ and _Tools_. I often find problem/use-case patterns with various projects and then the question comes up: **What was that tool I used before?**

<!-- In contrast there is always the _Why would I want to use this tool?_. **No, that is an anti-pattern!** The question is often asked by those that don't have the right context. Know the use case and apply tools to it, not the other way round. -->

## Use Cases

- Offline vscode-server installs.
- Downloading Urls.

<!-- - VSCode on 32bits?
- VSCode RemoteSSH?
- VSCode Spell Checking?
- VSCode Markdown Editing? -->
