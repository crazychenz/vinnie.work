title: To Inform
---

More organized than a log of findings, this corner of vinnie.work aims _to inform_. This section is written from the experience and conclusions that I've made over time. Unlike a stream of blog entries, I intend this information to remain organized and reference-able.

## Areas

- [Collections](./Collections/Overview) - Collections of similar things.

- [Problem Book](./ProblemBook/Overview) - Problem/use-case patterns that I've documented from various projects and tasks. Next time I ask: **What was that tool I used before?**, I'll hopefully be able to reference the tool or use case here.

- [Embedded System Analysis](./EmbeddedSystemsAnalysis/overview) - Some ramblings on my process for performing embedded systems analysis from primarily my software engineering back ground.

- [System Deets](./Systems/overview) - Summarized and distilled system specific information.

- [Workflows & Techniques](./EnvAndWorkflow/Overview)

- [Third Party](./ThirdParty/overview) - An open source _organization_ I maintain.

<!-- - [Visual Studio Code Tips](./VisualStudioCode/Overview) - I use visual studio code for almost everything I write now, from informal notes, to formal documentation, configs, and of course code. With all my weird use cases I've jotted down a bunch of things I've learned here. -->
