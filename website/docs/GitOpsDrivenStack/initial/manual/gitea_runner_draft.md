## Create Organization, Create Manual Repo, Setup System Runner

- Create a new organization called `lab`, visibility as `Private`, click "Create Organization".

- Create `system_manual` repository under `lab` organization via the web interface, visibility `Private`. Accept defaults and click "Create Repository".

- You should now have some commands as an example for using the new repo. We'll simply clone this into the `/opt/manuals` folder as `/opt/manuals/system_manual`:

  ```sh
  git clone git@git.lab:lab/system_manual.git
  ```

- Create docusaurus project (with `node:20-alpine` docker container).

  ```sh
  docker run -ti --rm \
    -u $(id -u) -w /opt/work -v $(pwd):/opt/work \
    node:20-alpine npx create-docusaurus@latest docusaurus classic
  ```

- Once it completes, commit/push to git to ensure you have a clean baseline. (From here on out, we'll assume that you know how to properly git commit/push with the exception of some general hints for when to commit/push as a suggestion.)

## Create act_runner configuration

**Caution:** Do not mix `var=val` and `var: val` conventions in the `environment:` section of any `docker-compose.yml` file. See [Github Issue 11267](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/11267) for more information.

```
# Create a state folder for our runner
sudo chown user /opt/state
mkdir -p /opt/state/gitea_sys_runner/data
# Generate a clean act_runner configuration
docker compose run --entrypoint "act_runner" gitea_sys_runner generate-config \
  > /opt/state/gitea_sys_runner/data/config.yaml
# Fetch registration token
docker compose exec -u 1000 gitea_svc \
  gitea --config /data/gitea/conf/app.ini actions generate-runner-token
```

```
# Register runner with gitea
docker compose run \
  --entrypoint "act_runner" -w /data -u 1000 gitea_sys_runner \
  register --no-interactive \
    --instance https://git.lab \
    --token 5Q7uvFgpZFOFKmzFGVgFh8X4dtwKj0qzcKJNcRg6 \
    --name sys_runner \
    --labels system,another
# Restart with compose to ensure auto start persistence
docker compose down gitea_sys_runner && docker compose up -d gitea_sys_runner
# Check Gitea runners for success
```

**Note:** Gitea documentation fails to mention that its autostart run.sh script assumes everything is run from data. This means that when we explicitly register the runner, it must be with the working directory `/data` as well. If not, the `.runner` state will be stored in `/.runner` and not saved into the host.

## Add Checkout Action

Create `actions` org, create `actions/checkout` repo, run the following commands:

```
git clone --mirror https://github.com/actions/checkout.git checkout
cd checkout
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin git@git.lab:actions/checkout.git
git push --mirror origin
```

## Setup Project Actions

- To enable actions for a repository, open the project in the Gitea Web GUI. 
- Go to the project Settings (roughly under the Fork button in the upper right).
- Under the "Advanced Settings" section, check the "Actions" checkbox.
- Click "Update Settings" at the bottom of the section.
- If successful, you'll now see an "Action" link in the top bar of the project between "Pull Requests" and "Packages".
- Click "Actions" to see past and/or present Action workflows and logs.

Once we setup a project to execute a workflow on an event, you can come to this page to see, in the browser, the action terminal output as its running.


Here is an example Gitea Action that you can put in `.gitea/workflows/deploy.yml` of a project folder.

**===================================================================**
**TODO:** !!Document the process to setup actions for a project!!
**===================================================================**

```yaml
name: Gitea Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ gitea.actor }} is testing out Gitea Actions üöÄ
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    #schedule:
    ## * is a special character in YAML so you have to quote this string
    #- cron:  '30 5,17 * * *'

jobs:
  asdf:
    #name: asdf
    #needs: [other_job]
    #defaults:
    #  run:
    #    shell: bash
    #    working-directory: ./scripts
    # Run unconditionally (i.e. run even if other_job fails)
    #if: ${{ always() }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "üéâ The job was automatically triggered by a ${{ gitea.event_name }} event."
      - run: echo "üêß This job is now running on a ${{ runner.os }} server hosted by Gitea!"
      - run: echo "üîé The name of your branch is ${{ gitea.ref }} and your repository is ${{ gitea.repository }}."
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: echo "üí° The ${{ gitea.repository }} repository has been cloned to the runner."
      - run: echo "üñ•Ô∏è The workflow is now ready to test your code on the runner."
      - name: List files in the repository
        run: |
          ls ${{ gitea.workspace }}
        #timeout-minutes: 10
      - run: echo "üçè This job's status is ${{ job.status }}."
```

When we push to `deploy` branch, the action is triggered. The action should be one of:

- A docker command to build something.
- An SSH command to run something remotely.`

Note: Since GitOps controls the configuration above the baseline system, it is accepted that some repositories will contain credentials or keys required for system automation. These configuration specific repositories are kept separate from the source code repositories.

```
name: proxy.vinnie.work
run-name: ${{ gitea.actor }} is deploying configs to proxy.vinnie.work.

on:
  push:
    branches: ['deploy']

jobs:
  build-oci:
    runs-on: [linux,cicd]
    steps:

    - name: Dump environment variables.
      run: env

    - name: Running webhook-rollout.sh @ proxy.vinnie.work
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
          -i /home/cicd/.ssh/id_rsa cicd@proxy.vinnie.work \
          /opt/proxy.vinnie.work-config/scripts/webhook-rollout.sh

    - name: Running webhook-rollout.sh @ k3s.vinnie.work
      run: |
        ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no \
          -i /home/cicd/.ssh/id_rsa cicd@k3s.vinnie.work \
          /opt/k3s.vinnie.work-config/scripts/webhook-rollout.sh
```

_docusaurus_

- Create public `actions` organization

- Create public/visible `checkout` repository in `actions` organization.

- Copy the github actions/checkout into our `checkout` repo. Optionally tag it appropriately (e.g. v4).

- _Setup manuals repo with workflow definition and other conventions._

- Enable Actions in manual repo settings. Click update settings.
