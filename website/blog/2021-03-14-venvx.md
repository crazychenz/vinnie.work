  In the Python 3 ecosystem there are tons of fantastic virtualenv tools like pipx, poetry, and pew. Sadly when you can't use PYthon 3 in a legacy piece of code you don't get the functionality from a simple pip command. I hope to change that, but for now here is a simple script. I present to you, **venvx**.
---

## Introduction

venvx is a sort of minimal combination of pipx and pew. It can be used in the development and testing of tools that exist in separate virtualenv virtual environments (similar to pew). It also has to ability to simply run console entrypoints that exist in other environments. Similar to pipx, venvx also has a run command that will build a new virtualenv just for the invocation of the command.

This script is minimal, meaning its not efficient or polished, but at this point can we really say anything in Python 2 is polished? This is a stop gap for projects that need to support npx like interfaces without the open source support.

## Activating venvx

Similar to virtualenv, its assumed that you'll be *activating* the script by sourcing in the script. This isn't strictly required, but significantly improves the user experience. Assuming this script is stored as something like `venvx.sh`, activate by running:

```
source venvx.sh
```

Once activated you'll have access to primary entrypoint of the tool: `venvx`.

## Create A New Environment

```
venvx new mytool
```

This will create a new virtualenv named `mytool` in the `$WORKON_HOME` folder. Note: `$WORKON_HOME` defaults to your current working directory plus `venv`. Therefore if you activate venvx from the home directory, `$WORKON_HOME` will default to `~/venv/` and mytool will be generated in `~/venv/mytool`.

As part of the venvx environment creation, it will automatically install pip and pipenv. This is intended to encourage usage of pipenv's lock files.

## Execute Entrypoint In Another Environment

```
venvx in mytool <command> [arguments]
```

This simply sets up the environment such that the given command and arguments will think that its running from the specified virtual environment.

## Activate VirtualEnv Environment

```
venvx workon mytool
```

When developing or testing and you don't want to prefix your commands with `venv in <venv>`, you can opt to activate the virtualenv. Instead of running yet another long ugly command (`source <venv>/bin/activate`), you simply run `venvx workon <venv>` which is intended to be more expressive and easy to remember. This is the same syntax as `pew` so it travels to Python 3 well when you need to context switch.

You can always keep switching between your various virtualenv's or you can deactivate with a simple `deactivate`.

## Run Command Without Virtualenv

```
venvx run <entrypoint>
```

This command assumes that the entry point being run matches the name of the package. But if this assumption is met it means that you can run commands without having to worry about installing them into your global user pip site-packages or worrying about managing a virtualenv just for the command. 

Seeing as this command is very simple, it literally rebuilds the virtualenv for each invocation of the entry point. With pip caching this can be slow the first time, but should be a quicker process in subsequent operations, but not lightweight or efficient to say the least.

## Uninstalling venvx

```
venvx deactivate
```

Run the above command to remove venvx from your current environment. I don't know why you'd want to do this `;-)`, but its good to have symmetry.

## venvx Shell Script

```
#!/bin/bash

WORKON_HOME=${WORKON_HOME:-$(realpath venv)}

function venvx() {
    action=$1
    shift

    if [ "$action" == "in" ]; then
        venv=$1
        shift
        VIRTUAL_ENV="${WORKON_HOME}/$venv" \
        PATH="${WORKON_HOME}/$venv/bin:$PATH" \
        ${*}
    elif [ "$action" == "new" ]; then
        venv=$1
        shift
        echo "Creating virtualenv: $venv"
        virtualenv -q ${WORKON_HOME}/$venv
        venvx in $venv pip -q install -U pip pipenv
    elif [ "$action" == "run" ]; then
        pkg=$1
        tmppath=$(mktemp -d --tmpdir="${WORKON_HOME}" -t .tmp.XXXXXXXXXX)
        shift
        echo "Creating temporary virtualenv for: $pkg"
        venvx new $tmppath
        venvx in $tmppath pip -q install -U $pkg
        venvx in $tmppath $pkg ${*}
        rm -rf $tmppath
    elif [ "$action" == "workon" ]; then
        venvx_type=$(type -t venvx)
        if [ "$venvx_type" != "function" ]; then
            echo "venvx workon requires venvx to be sourced"
        else
            venv=$1
            shift
            source ${WORKON_HOME}/$venv/bin/activate
        fi
    elif [ "$action" == "deactivate" ]; then
        venvx_type=$(type -t venvx)
        if [ "$venvx_type" != "function" ]; then
            echo "venvx deactivate requires venvx to be sourced"
        else
            unset -f venvx
        fi
    else
        echo "venvx <action> [options]"
        echo
        echo "Actions:"
        echo "  - in ........... Executes commands within given virtual environment."
        echo "  - new .......... Creates a new empty virtual environment."
        echo "  - run .......... Creates a new virtualenv to run pkg entrypoint."
        echo "  - workon ....... Activates the specified virtualenv."
        echo "  - deactivate ... Removes venvx from environment."
        echo "  - help ......... Displays this help message."
        echo
    fi
}

[[ $_ != $0 ]] && echo "\`venvx\` activation complete." || venvx $@
```
