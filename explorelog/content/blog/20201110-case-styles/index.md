## Case Styles

Reading through Google news, I came across a term I never heard before that really stuck with me. "kebab-case". This is often what I use when naming files that are composed up multiple words. Others were suggesting that this is the best convention for git branch names as well. To recap, here is a list of the different case types:

- [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) - Commonly used as Instance names in OO languages.
- PascalCase - Commonly used as Class names in OO languages.
- [snake_case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) - Common convention for K&R C.
- kebab-case - Good for filenames, git branches
- [StUDlyCAps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studly_caps) - Good for trolling and texting while driving.

Of course there is a Wikipedia article on the subject: [Naming Convention (Programming)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)>)

There is also a more general linguistic article on [Letter Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case). In this article they include things such as:

- Sentence case - "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
- Title case - "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps over the Lazy Dog"
- Start case - "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"
- All caps - "THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG"
- Small caps - _All caps with a font face size smaller than the normal font face size._
- Lower case - "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

There are more and each with their subtle differences and rules.
