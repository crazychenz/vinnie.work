  A phrase that caught my ear "I intend to..." from a podcast had peaked my 
  interest. This has lead me to searching for other information on the 
  subject, leading to some great takeaways following me listening to some
  interviews of the author David Marquet from [Turn The Ship Around!](https://www.davidmarquet.com/turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-turning-followers-into-leaders-by-david-marquet/).

## Background

Recently while listening to a _Soft Skills Engineering_ podcast [Correcting English and Tyranny of the Urgent](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7ByEtUGl9Hp4L7ljdfzoAH?si=oH8CYN-bTQuqbu7psdN7AA), a topic was brought up about solving technical debt and escaping the "Tyranny of the Urgent". The discussion that followed was informative, but one of the hosts mentioned a term "I intend to" that originated from a book called [Turn The Ship Around!](https://www.davidmarquet.com/turn-the-ship-around-a-true-story-of-turning-followers-into-leaders-by-david-marquet/).

This one little comment got me really thinking so I went off to do some of my own research on the subject. I'm not a big book reader, so I didn't read the above referenced book, but I did listen to some interviews of the author on another podcast called EM Weekly. They actually did two podcasts with the author that were very informative and aligned quite well with Lean methodologies and Agile philosophy. These two podcast episodes were:

- [Transforming Leadership with David Marquet](https://open.spotify.com/episode/60nDO33UfUsXKyA1yaOx7D?si=CuwX_HwXQWuW-1QfEp8n9Q)

- [Turn The Ship Around Applying I Intend to to Your Team](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5uJRsxmui7arjXri9o0S2x?si=x-JJAOiLRyW6TRH15VmaGA)

## My Takeaways

### Don't Brief, Act

Time and time again, management will brief, dictate, or speak on improving collaboration, improving productivity through philosophies like Lean/Agile, and effectively directing the group to sing kumbaya on queue. This type of action is likely nothing but hot air and lost on the audience.

Jerry Sternin is quoted as saying, "It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, than think your way into a new way of acting".

The big point to make here is that leaders should be setting ground rules that force workers to think differently instead of attempting to have folks act differently based on what the leaders are saying or thinking. It also should go without saying that leading by example is a great way to show thing kind of action instead of leading by position.

### Pause To Encourage Thinking

Often we do repeated tasks that can cause us to go into auto-pilot mode. When driving to work, sometimes you look back on the experience and wonder _How did I make that merge and not remember doing it?_. In the workplace, taking a moment to pause before doing any action that will have side effects can give your brain time to process whether your immediate intention is a mistake.

When dealing with actions that have safety ramifications, a good way to encourage folks to slow down and thing about their actions is to have a ground rule that forces workers to state out loud what their intention is. When working in pairs or groups, this can easily give your peers the oppurtunity to suggest course corrections in the moment. I like to think of this as similar to a bunch of kitchen cooks yelling out orders and their current cooking station's state.

### Encourage **Solicited** Feedback

One of my top key values in an organization is having continuous feedback from the customer or user of the product I am contributing to or developing. Often, this kind of feedback is driven by me as the contributor. In contrast, you could be a peer or user of something and provide unsolicited feedback. This can become an awkward situation where folks feel more judged or attacked.

Instead of encouraging unsolicited feedback, as a leader, you should be attempting to instill a culture where everyone sets aside a time and process for feedback. In other words, a healthy organization is one where workers are asking for feedback instead of providing unsolicited feedback.

[A Summary of Growth and Fixed Mindsets](https://fs.blog/2015/03/carol-dweck-mindset/) is a blog post on different mindsets. Knowing that some folks an predisposed to a fixed mindset where you want everyone to have a growth mindset is the first step in being able to shift a culture where everyone whats to achieve excellence and not just aim to not mess up.

### Knowing and Not Telling, Returning Problems Unsolved

This is a subject that I've really only become aware of myself over the past 2 years. Its the idea that even if you think you have the solution, as a leader you should avoid always providing the answer. Allowing folks that report to you to solve the problem themselves gives them a sense of ownership, encouragage more critical thinking, and decreases their dependence on you as the senior engineer. David Marquet refers to this as "Knowing and telling vs knowing and not-telling." and "returning the problem unsolved."

For more junior engineers, perhaps the simplest approach is to ask the questions:

- What do you see as the problem?
- What do you think about the problem?
- What do you want to do about it?

### 3 Minute Meetings

Marquet also had a great idea for leads that find themselves unavailable to their workforce in ways that may inhibit implementing Lean methodologies or Agile philosophies. The idea is that you can have something like 3 minute meetings. One way to structure this is:

- Have a 30 minute block in the day to talk with ~10 people, each 3 minutes. Depending on the type of culture in the organization, this could be as simple as having everyone line up outside the door or giving each person at a conference table their time to talk around the room.
- Allowing folks to quickly explain their situation gives you the lead the availability to ensure that tasking being performed isn't wasted and that the task aligns with what you know at your level.
- The extremely short meeting time encourages engineers to be efficient in their talk but also, instead of an elevator speech, this is predictable and can be planned for.

### Encourage Intention (not Permission)

All of these, IMO, good points build us up to the final take away which is to implement a culture of intention, not permission. When you ask for permission to do something in an organization, you're basically shifting responsibility to someone else. This isn't fair to the proposer or the lead making the decision. Instead, having the engineer or contributor stating their intention and giving the lead the opportunity to reject the intention allows the contributor to keep ownership and responsibility of their idea.

Marquet stated that this kind of culture shift doesn't always work and he sees it as depending on two major factors:

- Technical Health and Competency - Not the just the ability to perform the job, but the ability to see how systems work and why they are implemented/designed the way they are.
- Well understood Clarity and Priority of the organization - As in having a good road map and appropriate levels of priorities for the workforce to understand what needs doing without dictating how things should be done.

This pretty much goes hand in hand with traditional systems engineering and requirements development. When developing requirements, you write down _what_ needs to be done, not _how_ something should be done.

In a healthy organization, all members of that team will understand what needs to get done. If that team is technically healthy and has a depth of knowledge on how to accomplish the goals and priorities of the organization, they are likely to be a good candidate for **stating intentions** instead of **asking for permission**. In practice, you schedule time with a manager or team lead and use the words "I intent do _do a thing to solve problem X._" Without an explicit rejection, this wording implies permission to go forth and do good things.

This culture prevents leads from ever having to give specific direction and instead allows leaders to control how their workforce communicates and effectively accomplishes the tasks that need to get done. Also, because this type of culture allows folks to keep ownership and responsibility of their decisions, it breeds leadership qualities into that same workforce.

Marquet has mentioned that he's enforced this in times of emergency as well as in more calm situations. But it really depends on allowing the workforce to master their skills and have the ability to act in situations instead of depending on a process. _A fire fighter isn't going to wait until a fire chief arrives to point the hose at the flame. They simply point the hose at the flame with an understanding of the ramifications when they do._
