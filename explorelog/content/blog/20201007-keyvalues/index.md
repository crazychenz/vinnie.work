  A different way to look for software shops.

[KeyValues](https://www.keyvalues.com/) is a web site that matches software engineers by their desirable values. This is kind of neat because it pre-filters companies that you may find yourself miserable at because you simply joined because of potential of location, money, or prestiege.

I believe these to be my key values at this point in my life:

In addition to listing company values with their explanation of how they satisfy particular values, you can subscribe to the site for great interview questions to ask.
